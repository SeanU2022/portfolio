## Description
This portfolio showcases the skills and talents I have for a role in website development. It demonstrates abilities with Front End design and coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition, as a Full stack developer, you will see the use of Frameworks, Database, and related technologies.  I have deployed several projects using GitHub with live links in the portfolio.

The core skills I have include: HTML/CSS (flex, bootstrap, tailwind), Javascript client (including JQuery), NodeJS (OOP/async/JSON), experience with Browser/3rd party (domain, openweathermap, ...)/Custom Server side API's, REST routing, framework libraries (moment.js, fontawesome, inquirer, chalk, fs, express, bcrypt, sequalize, mysql2), tools (TDD using jest, insomnia, RapidAPI, postman), SQL, ORM, ... , and of course GitHub.

**Note:** You will see some application links use placeholder images and names which will change over time as future projects get added to the portfolio.
